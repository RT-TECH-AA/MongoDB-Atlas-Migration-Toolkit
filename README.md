# MongoDB Atlas Migration Toolkit

A set of tools to help those migrating from the Community Edition of MongoDB to [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
This script is designed to gather and display various statistics about a MongoDB cluster. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does:

## 1. Validate dbAdmin Role:

Checks if the current user has the dbAdmin role required to collect information. If not, it prints a message indicating that the user lacks the necessary permissions.
## 2. Compare Data Sizes:

Retrieves and compares the storage and data sizes for each database in the cluster:
storageSize: Total size used on disk, including compressed data and indexes.
dataSize: Uncompressed size of the data.
Computes compression ratio as a percentage of the difference between dataSize and storageSize.
Print Database Details:

Optionally prints details for each database, including size on disk, data size, and compression percentage.
Compute and Print Cluster Totals:

Calculates total storage and data sizes across all databases.
Converts storage sizes to gigabytes.
Computes and prints total compression percentage for the cluster.
System and Replication Information:

Displays system information like RAM and vCPUs.
If the cluster is part of a replica set, it prints the number of nodes and oplog statistics:
Total oplog size
Used oplog space
Oplog window (in hours)
Average oplog size per hour
Backup and Disk Space Information:

Prints total data size and the size on disk.
Provides details on the file system used and total file system size, along with the percentage of file system used.
This script is useful for monitoring and analyzing MongoDB cluster statistics, including database sizes, compression, replication, and system resources.

## Cluster Stats
The [cluster-stats.js](cluster-stats.js) script executes various MongoDB Shell commands to summarize your existing MongoDB environment. This is not intended as a sizing exercise, but rather a simple utility to help you map your existing runtime environment to its Atlas equivalent. 

The user running the script must have the [dbAdmin](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/#dbAdmin) role.

To run the script, save [cluster-stats.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wbleonard/atlas-migration-toolkit/master/cluster-stats.js) to your local machine. You can then pass the script to the shell as follow:

```
mongo < cluster-stats.js
```
Or if you prefer, start the shell and load the script:
```
PRIMARY> load('cluster-stats.js')
```

The results will look as follows:

```
=== Cluster Totals ===

-- Host Information --> Map to AtlasCluster Tier
